 **Bugs Report**
 
   -Introduction

   Welcome to the Bug Report section of our Library Management System (LMS). This part provides guidelines on reporting bugs effectively and 
   outlines our process to address them. We aim to maintain a robust and error-free system by collaborating openly with our community of users and 
   developers.

   To report a bug, please follow these steps:

   Check Existing Reports: Before submitting a new bug report, check if the issue has already been reported. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and 
   ensures that we can focus on new problems.

   Use the Bug Report Template: When reporting a bug, use the template provided below. This ensures that all necessary information is included, 
   which helps us in diagnosing and fixing the bug more efficiently.

   -Bug Report Template:

      Title: Provide a brief, descriptive title.
      Environment: Specify the software version, along with details about the operating system.
      Reproduction Steps: Clearly outline the steps to reproduce the bug.
      Expected Behavior: Describe what you expect to happen when following the steps above.
      Observed Behavior: Describe what actually happens.
      Screenshots/Logs: Attach any relevant screenshots or logs.
      Severity: Rate the severity of the bug (e.g., minor, major, critical).
      Submit Through GitHub: Use our GitHub issues page to submit your bug report. This centralizes our tracking and allows for community discussion 
      and contribution.

   -Bug Fixing Process

      Our team is committed to addressing all reported bugs as follows:

      Review and Assessment: Each bug report is reviewed by a team member to assess its validity and impact. We may reach out for additional 
      information.

      Prioritization: Bugs are prioritized based on their severity, frequency, and impact on the overall system. Critical bugs are handled I 
      mmediately, while less severe bugs are scheduled for future releases.

      Fixing: Our developers work to fix the bug. We aim to keep the community updated on our progress through comments in the GitHub issue.

      Testing: Once a fix is implemented, it undergoes thorough testing in both development and staging environments to ensure that the issue is 
      fully resolved.

      Release: Fixed bugs are included in the next software release. Each release is accompanied by release notes that detail the changes, including 
      bug fixes.

   -Versioning and Releases

      We release updates regularly to ensure that the system remains reliable and secure. Each release includes a version number, and we adhere to 
      semantic versioning to reflect the nature of changes made:

      Major releases (e.g., 1.0, 2.0) include significant changes and new features.
      Minor releases (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) typically include improvements and minor feature additions.
      Patch releases (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) focus primarily on bug fixes and minor enhancements.
